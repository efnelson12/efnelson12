- 👋 Hi, I’m @efnelson12
- 👀 My current research uses the extented degradation of ancient proteins to help provide ages to terrestrial and marine deposits relevant to understanding climate change 
- in Northern Europe. In addition I want to use this knowledge to help test the accuracy of paleoclimate models for projecting interglacial/ glacial transitions in the last 2.6 million yers
- 🌱 I’m currently learning I am currently learning how to extract the required data out of climate specific data files such as netCDF4 and LiPD files and using this data to improve the
- our knowledge of the climate system, what possible perturbations caused extreme climate variability in the past and what it can inform us about the future. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to what I said above.
- 📫 How to reach me please email my efn509@york.ac.uk
